## Overview

[![screenshot](screenshot.png)](https://devchallenges-edie-homepage-master.vercel.app/)

This one was a pain ! I must admit I didn't think enough about the responsive aspects of the page in advance, so I had a hard time managing it afterwards. I tried to make a simple sticky mobile menu in css, which isn't perfect.  
In the end, even if I didn't learn any new technology with this project, I gained a lot of experience by doing mistakes I won't repeat in the future !

Which I didn't follow enough, at least the first part, thinking about the responsiveness in advance. Lesson learnt !
